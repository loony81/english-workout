In American English we use 'on' with weekends, in British English we use 'at'. Weekend is mostly used in singular form (always preceded with 'the') and can mean either a specific weekend (previous or upcoming) or any weekend. But remember that 'the' is not used when talking about last weekend (прошлые выходные) or next weekned (следующие выходные), for example: She cleaned the room last weekend. It can also be used in its plural form (on weekends or  on the weekends can be used interchangeably) when we're talking about something habitual"
